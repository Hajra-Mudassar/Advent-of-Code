# Advent-of-Code
The Advent of Code is an annual programming event that takes place during the month of December. Each day, a new programming puzzle is released, presenting unique challenges for participants to solve. The puzzles are designed to test your problem-solving abilities, algorithmic thinking, and understanding of data structures.

In this repository, I have uploaded my collection of Python solutions for the Advent of Code puzzles from December 2022. The files with txt extension contain the input while the files with the py extension contain the program that can process that input for a specific day, labelled in the name accordingly. PyCharm was used to develop these codes and references are included where other sources were used. 
Th excercises are significantly useful because they help improve programming skills, provide learning opportunities, and foster a supportive community of programmers.
